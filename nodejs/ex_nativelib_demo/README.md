Demo NODEJS call C++

C++ code is in: anyka_v380ipcam_experiments/nodejs/ex_node_nativelib (see readne how to compile)

The file generated by the library (ex_node_nativelib/build/cpp-demo-0.0.1.zip) must be unzipped in the `node_modules` folder.

The folder "node_modules", I'm doing it manually leaving the least possible dependencies. 
The only dependency needed is (../nodejs/ex_node_nativelib/node_modules/bindings) , must be copied to `node_modules`.

To RUN copy this folder to device and run using:

node test-native.js
